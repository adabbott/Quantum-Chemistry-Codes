DIIS
accelerate convergence of wavefucntion
give code some pre computed fock matrices
compute error matrices
solve some equations 
get coefficients on how to mix fock matrices and you get your fock matrix


define error in terms of off diagonal, since a diagonal fock matrix is converged

qn coeff we solve for



solve in numpy, skip the first eigen value, the rest is your q1 through qi 
make copy of fock matrix 
can put in same vector over and over again if you want

diis doesnt guarantee landing on the actual solution
can land on incorrect state




put DIIS after you form the fock matrix, throw in DIIS

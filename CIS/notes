computing excitation energies, not the total energies, teh excitatino from your ground energies
eigenvalues, 
eigenvectors are the c_K matrix, to get the percentage just square the value in the eigenvectors
no need to print the possible excitations
code up equation 0.2 and digonalize to to eigenvalues and eigenvectors(????)

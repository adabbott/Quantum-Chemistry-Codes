3 center 2 electron integral and a metirc, which is a two center integral eqn 0.5

normal p and q phis are normal basis set. Xchi capital P is the auxiliary basis set

advantageous to refactor J into two components
each half we call a b integral, which is a 3 center integral times the metric. their product and sum over q is the original
two electron integral

Naux is much much smaller than Nao??

larger aux basis or orbital basis can reduce error

add on density fitted MP2
print both MP2 and DFMP2 and give the error between the two

df_basis for the auxilliary

mints can take basis sets for each center 
mints.ao_eri(bs1, bs2, bs3, bs4)
first two are bra side, second two are ket side  (basis set, zero, basis set, zero)

where do you use this zero basis set (i guess just above)

block_tei function needs to be modified, dont need to do two electorn integrals in the bra and the ket.

may need to code chemist notation version of MP2

tensor dot faster than einsum.. einsum just for loops

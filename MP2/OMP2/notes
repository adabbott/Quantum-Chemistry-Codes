generalize fock matrix that has these mp2 corrections to it, the Tau, in terms of lambda in terms of t2s
gammas 1 particle density matrix and 2 particle density matrix
Fp to q is in the MO basis

how far off from being diagonal is it (the MO gradient) how far off from being converged you are

orbital rotation matrix 

Cold is convereged hartree fock coefficients
keep around your ao integrals ao hamiltonian etc

whenver you update t2's use 0.11

check converged, can do taht by looking at gradient or energy

if not converged, go back to forming tau

reoptimizing orbitals, each iteration your updating your orbitals (coefficients)
integral transformation every single iteration
